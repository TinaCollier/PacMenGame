# PacMen Game
For this MITxPro challenge, we were tasked with making a game that factory produced PacMen. Then we had to make the PacMen bounce off the walls continuously. 

To challenge myself, I made the PacMen chomp as the moved across the screen. Then I made them face the direction of their movement while chomping.

# What I Found Challenging
My program isn't perfect by far. The chomping toggle doesn't work perfectly. I wasn't sure what the best method was to loop through the images, but I was able to make it work pretty well with the `imageChange` function and a `setInterval` function. I will come back to this program and see if I can make it work smoother in the future.
